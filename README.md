GTest is a testing package revolving around the amazing
GoConvey assertions. It's for those of you who like its assertions
but do not like BDD style testing.

Examples:

Do a test and call t.Fatal if it fails


	So(a, ShouldResemble, b).ElseFatal(t)

Do a test and call t.Error if it fails


	So(a, ShouldResemble, b).ElseError(t)

Do a test and call your own function if it fails


	So(a, ShouldResemble, b).Else(func(msg string) {
		t.Fatalf("\nfailed at index %d\n%s", i, msg)
	})

Make your own test object so you don't need to pass `t` every time.


	g := NewTest(t)
	g.So(a, ShouldResemble, b).ElseError()

## func NewTest
``` go
func NewTest(t *testing.T) *test
```
NewTest creates a new test object. This is not needed unless you
want to pass in your own `t` at initialization.


## func So
``` go
func So(actual interface{}, assert func(actual interface{}, expected ...interface{}) string, expected ...interface{}) sotest
```
So is a convenience function for running assertions on arbitrary arguments
in any context, be it for testing or even application logging. It allows you
to perform assertion-like behavior (and get nicely formatted messages detailing
discrepancies) but without the program blowing up or panicing. All that is
required is to import this package and call `So` with one of the assertions
exported by this package as the second parameter.
This function uses the default test object created by the package.
